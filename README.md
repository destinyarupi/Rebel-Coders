# Rebel-Coders
This is my second capstone project from the side hustle internship (Group 90)

## Work Description
1. The navigation bar was styled and made responsive with css and the hamburger menu was done with JS
2. The form was done with bootstrap and the background was designed with CSS
3. The password eye toogle was done with JS
4. Validation was done with HTML 
5. The footer was done with CSS

## Problems 
Other group members were inactive and I had to carried out the whole project alone. I tried various methods of form validation with JS but I couldn't get it to work.
